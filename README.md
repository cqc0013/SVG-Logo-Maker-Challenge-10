# SVG-Logo-Maker
Week-10 Challenge

## User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Technologies Used
This project uses Node.js, npm, and jest.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/cqc0013/SVG-Logo-Maker-Challenge-10.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install inquirer and jest directly from the command line, to do so the command for inquirer will be npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and npm i jest to install the latest version of jest).

6. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.
